SOC Home Lab: Splunk SIEM & Log Analysis

🎯 Objective

This project aims to establish a functional SOC environment to ingest, analyze, and monitor logs from multiple endpoints. By configuring a Universal Forwarder on Ubuntu to send data to Splunk Enterprise on Windows, I simulated real-world log telemetry and built custom detection rules.

  🛠️ Tools Used

• SIEM: Splunk Enterprise (Windows)

• Endpoints: Ubuntu (Linux)

• Agent: Splunk Universal Forwarder

• Networking: VirtualBox/VMware Host-Only Adapter

📁 Repository Structure

• /Architecture: Network diagrams of the lab setup.

• /Configs: Custom inputs.conf and outputs.conf files.

• /Detections: Documentation of Splunk SPL queries and alerts.

• /Scripts: Scripts used for log generation or automation.
