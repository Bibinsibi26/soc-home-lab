SOC Home Lab: Splunk SIEM & Log Analysis

🎯 Objective

This project aims to establish a functional SOC environment to ingest, analyze, and monitor logs from multiple endpoints. By configuring a Universal Forwarder on Ubuntu to send data to Splunk Enterprise on Windows, I simulated real-world log telemetry and built custom detection rules.

🛠️ Tools Used

• SIEM: Splunk Enterprise (Windows)

• Endpoints: Ubuntu (Linux)

• Agent: Splunk Universal Forwarder

• Networking: VirtualBox/VMware Host-Only Adapter
